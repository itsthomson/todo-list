# todo-list

I'm learning Clojure and this is a To-do list, per [this
tutorial](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure-webapps/create-a-project/update-project-details.html).

## CircleCI and GAE

I'm also combining the above tutorial on creating a to-do list with [this
tutorial](https://circleci.com/blog/deploying-clojure-applications-to-google-cloud/)
on continuous deployment to Google App Engine using CircleCI.

## lol

It looks like the first link is an incomplete tutorial. I'm going to divert from
the tutorial and figure out how to create a to-do app myself.

## To-do (for this to-do list app)

* Set up Datomic (harder than I thought--looks like there's little support on
  GCP)
* Add a task
* Complete a task
